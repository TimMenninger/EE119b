Game of Life

This was implemented such that the only way for data to change is on the
rising edge of the Tick signal.  Therefore, if data is being shifted through
the array, then Ticks must occur with the Shift signal active.  Both Tick
and Shift are assumed to be active high.

This does not pass my testbench, however, I believe that is partially because
the test bench is incorrect--it doesn't input the correct vectors, obtained
from the life_vectors.txt file.  I think the reason for this is because the
only way I could get it to compile was by reading the array rows in as
integers then converting them to std_logic_vectors, around line 350 in
life_tb.vhd.  That said, I still think it works assuming I correctly assumed
how/when to Shift (above)...

The life_vectors.txt was generated by generate_test_vectors.py
